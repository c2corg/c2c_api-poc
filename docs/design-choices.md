## Why Flask ?

[Django](https://github.com/django/django) is by far the most popular python web framework. But it meant to build full HTTP app, from ORM, bakend, to front-end. It handles thousand of aspects we don't need for a REST API. And it's API is more complex, with a steepest learnign curve.

[Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) is way simpler to learn, and support out-of-the box REST API feature. And it's the second mosat popular python web framework, with a gentle learning curve, with no complex abstraction. Go for it !

## Why a custom extension

Because I did not found something that fit our needs : 

* Headless wiki API
* Versionning
* Reasonnably used 
* Configuration in text files (not an admin interface where we can't follow what's done)
* SGIS capabilities
